# What's This?

An attempt to make my personal Atom Editor configuration as portable/repeatable as possible.

Making settings portable isn't straightforward at this point in time:

> So if you zipped up the contents of the ~/.atom directory, that would achieve what you're asking for. You might want to be a little selective about what you archived because some things that are stored in the ~/.atom directory aren't really meant to be transplanted ... say across versions of Atom.


Settings and packages are stored in the `~/.atom` directory.

## Packages

```
apm install react
apm install linter
apm install project-manager
apm install vim-mode
```
